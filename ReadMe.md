# Welcome to **Web Fundamentals**!
This is a repository for all the code we will be using during algorithms and lectures in this course.

The contents of each lecture will be associated with the folder that the lecture code is in.

> i.e. the code from lecture on HTML inputs will be in the HTML folder, labeled something like "inputslecture.html"
